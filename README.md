# dino-chrome-game

"Play Chrome Dino game with a twist project" is a computer vision project that utilizes several Python libraries, including #cv2, #mediapipe, #matplotlib, #pyplot, and #pynput. The goal of this project is to create an interactive version of the popular Chrome Dino game where the player controls the character using their hand gestures.
The project involves using the computer's webcam to detect the player's hand gestures and translate them into game commands. This is achieved using the cv2 and mediapipe libraries, which provide powerful tools for computer vision tasks such as hand tracking and gesture recognition.
To visualize the game and the player's hand movements, the project uses the matplotlib and pyplot libraries to create a graphical user interface. This allows the player to see the game and their hand movements in real-time, making the experience more immersive and interactive.
Finally, the #pynput library is used to simulate keyboard inputs, allowing the player's hand gestures to control the game. By mapping specific hand gestures to game commands, the player can jump, duck, and move the character left and right to avoid obstacles and collect points.
Overall, "Play Chrome Dino game with a twist" is a fun and challenging project that demonstrates the power of computer vision and Python libraries for creating interactive games and applications.
